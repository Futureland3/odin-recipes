    <h2>Description</h2> 
    <p>Ward off everything from vampires to the weeknight dinner blues—and maybe even the common cold—with our ultra-craveable, creamy, pancetta-topped roasted garlic soup.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3-4 heads of garlic</li>
        <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>4-8 oz pancetta, diced</li>
        <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
        <li>4 cups chicken stock</li>
        <li>1/2 cups parmesan cheese, grated</li>
        <li>2 cups kale, ribs removed, shredded</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350ºF</li>
        <li>Trim the tops off 4 of the heads of garlic. Just enough to expose all its cloves. Pour ½ tablespoon olive oil over the exposed cloves and sprinkle with a little salt and pepper. Place each bulb right side up on a small square of foil. Fold the foil around the bulb of garlic and place on a cookie sheet. Roast the garlic for 45 minutes. Cool thoroughly.</li>
        <li>In a large pot, cook diced pancetta over medium heat until crispy, about 5-7 minutes. Drain off all but 1 tablespoon of pancetta fat. Reserve crispy pancetta in bowl. Add chopped onion to pancetta drippings in pan. Sauté onions until they start to caramelize, about 10 minutes</li>
        <li>When roasted garlic is cooled, press it out of its skins. Add it to a blender along with the chicken stock and cooked onions. Purée the soup until smooth.</li>
        <li>Return soup to the pot, add kale and parmesan and bring to a simmer until kale is tender. Add cream and heat until desired temperature. Sprinkle the pancetta evenly among bowls and serve.</li>
    </ol>
